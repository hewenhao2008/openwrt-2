<sect1>About
<p>
<bf>
<url url="http://www.gnugk.org/" name="The GNU Gatekeeper">
</bf>
is an open-source project that implements an H.323 gatekeeper.
A gatekeeper provides call control services to the H.323 endpoints.
It is an integral part of most useful internet telephony
installations that are based on the H.323 standard.

According to Recommendation H.323, a gatekeeper shall provide the
following services:
<itemize>
<item>Address Translation
<item>Admissions Control
<item>Bandwidth Control
<item>Zone Management
<item>Call Control Signaling
<item>Call Authorization
<item>Bandwidth Management
<item>Call Management
</itemize>

The GNU Gatekeeper implements most of these functions
based on the
<url url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openh323" name="OpenH323">
protocol stack.

Recommendation H.323 is an international standard published by the
<url url="http://www.itu.int/" name="ITU">.
It is a communications standard for audio, video, and data over the Internet.

<url url="http://www.packetizer.com/voip/h323/papers/primer/" name="A Primer on the H.323 Series Standard">.

For a detailed description of what a gatekeeper does, see

<sect1>Copyright
<p>
It is covered by the
<htmlurl url="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" name="GNU General Public License version 2"> (GNU GPL v2).
In addition to that, we explicitly grant
the right to link this code to the OpenH323/H323Plus and OpenSSL library.

Some protocols implemented in the GNU Gatekeeper are covered by patents (especially the
firewall / NAT traversal protocols). To the best of our knowledge, the GNU Gatekeeper Project
has a valid license for all its releases, but users making derived versions of this code have
to ensure that they also have a sufficient license before enabling those features.

Generally speaking, the GNU GPL allows you to copy, distribute, resell or modify
the software, but it requires that all derived works must be published
under GNU GPL also.
That means that you must publish full source for all extensions to
the gatekeeper and for all programs you include the gatekeeper into.
See the file COPYING for details.

If that's not what you want, you must interface to the gatekeeper through
the status port and communicate via TCP with it.
That way you only have to integrate the basic functionality into
the gatekeeper (and provide source for that) and can keep other parts
of your application private.
